==DETECT v2-related scripts==

This GitHub repository provides scripts related to DETECT (the Density 
Estimation Tool for Enzyme ClassificaTion), as has been organized into the 
following directories with further instructions (README) in each directory:

    (1) DETECT enzyme annotation tool
	(2) Pipeline for creating DETECT db locally
	(3) Pipeline for creating DETECT db using SciNet
	
The first directory provides scripts and small files for running DETECTv2 as
a tool for enzyme annotation. Complete databases can be downloaded at 
http://compsysbio.org/projects/DETECTv2/

The second and third directories provide scripts for creating the database for
DETECT from scratch; the former is for running scripts on a desktop computer,
while the latter is for running scripts on either an infrastructure like
SciNet or using a cluster of computers more generally (which would require
modifications by the user).

The paper for v2 is in press: Nursimulu N., Xu L.Y., Wasmuth J.D., Krukov I. and Parkinson J. (2018). Improved enzyme annotation with EC-specific cutoffs using DETECT v2. Bioinformatics. 

v1 has been published as well: Hung et al (2010), Bioinformatics vol. 26, no. 14.
